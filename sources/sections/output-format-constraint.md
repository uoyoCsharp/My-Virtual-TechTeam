## Output Format Constraint (Mandatory)

All persisted document output (markdown written to disk) MUST follow the formatting rules below. These rules govern *how* content is rendered, independent of the language it is written in.
**Scope**: artifact files, generated reports, plans, design documents, and any markdown written to disk. These rules do NOT apply to conversational output in the chat.

**Rules**:
- **Diagrams**: Express flowcharts, architecture, sequence, and structure diagrams as fenced `mermaid` code blocks. Do NOT draw diagrams with ASCII art (boxes made of `+`, `-`, `|`, arrows like `-->` outside mermaid, etc.).
- **Tables**: Render tabular data as Markdown tables (`| col | col |`). Do NOT simulate tables with space- or tab-aligned text.
- **Code**: Place code, commands, and config snippets in fenced code blocks with a language tag (e.g. ```` ```ts ````, ```` ```bash ````, ```` ```yaml ````). Do NOT leave code in bare or untagged fences.
- **Headings**: Use the Markdown heading hierarchy (`#` -> `##` -> `###`) without skipping levels. Do NOT use bold text as a substitute for a heading.

**Notes**:
- If a diagram genuinely cannot be expressed in mermaid (e.g. a precise spatial/pixel layout), state that explicitly and prefer a Markdown table or prose description over ASCII art.
- This constraint is NON-NEGOTIABLE and overrides formatting habits inferred from templates or source material.
