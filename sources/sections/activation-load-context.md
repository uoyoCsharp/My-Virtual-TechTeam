## Activation Protocol

### Step 1: Load Context
Load these files as foundational context:
- `.ai-agents/workspace/project-context.yaml` -- Project index (structural info)
- `.ai-agents/registry.yaml` -- Available skills registry and knowledge declarations
{{?extended_context}}

Extended context for this skill:
{{/extended_context}}
{{#extended_context}}
- {{.}}
{{/extended_context}}

### Step 2: Resolve Project Scope (PS)

Read `project-context.yaml > projects[]`.

**Single project** (`projects.length == 1`): Set PS = [sole project name]. Skip remaining PS steps.

**Multi-project** (`projects.length > 1`):
**Mode A -- Plan-driven** (active plan exists and skill operates on plan tasks):
1. **Plan signal**: PS = current task's `project` array from plan's `current_tasks`. Drop stale project names (not in `projects[]`), fall through.
2. **Path match**: Match current working paths against `projects[].path` and `source_paths`.
3. **Prompt**: If still unresolved, list candidates and ask user. Never silently load all projects.

**Mode B -- Non-plan** (no active plan or ad-hoc changes):
Defer PS to execution: identify change target, match against `projects[].path` and `source_paths`, load project-specific knowledge on demand (Step 3).

### Step 3: Load Knowledge

Registry uses project-keyed maps; `_all` is a reserved key (all projects). Applies to both top-level `knowledge` and `skills.<name>.knowledge`.

**Knowledge Loading Protocol**:
For each knowledge entry in the registry, follow these steps:
1. **Read the `source` field** from the registry entry (e.g., `knowledge/project/_generated/`).
2. **Construct the base directory**: join `.ai-agents/` with the `source` value → `.ai-agents/{source_value}/`.
3. **Load files**:
   - `files: [a.md, b.md]` → load `.ai-agents/{source_value}/a.md`, `.ai-agents/{source_value}/b.md`.
   - `files_from_manifest: true` → read `.ai-agents/{source_value}/manifest.yaml`, load entries with `auto_load: true`.
4. **Skip non-existent paths** silently (do not error or warn).

**Worked example**:
Given this registry entry:
```yaml
- id: project-context
  source: knowledge/project/_generated/
  files:
    - project-context.md
```
Resolution: `.ai-agents/` + `knowledge/project/_generated/` + `project-context.md` = `.ai-agents/knowledge/project/_generated/project-context.md`

**Anti-pattern -- DO NOT**:
- Guess or hardcode base directories (e.g., `.ai-agents/workspace/`).
- Assume a default path structure. The `source` field value is the authoritative path component.

**At activation** (both modes): load `knowledge._all` + `skills.<current-skill>.knowledge._all`.
**Mode A** (additionally): for each P in PS, load `knowledge[P]` + `skills.<current-skill>.knowledge[P]`.
**Mode B** (during execution): on demand, load `knowledge[P]` + `skills.<current-skill>.knowledge[P]` for identified project(s).
