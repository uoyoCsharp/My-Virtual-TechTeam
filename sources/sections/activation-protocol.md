## Activation Protocol

Two blocks: **Load** (what to read, and when) then **Resolve** (what to decide). All read mechanics live in Load; Resolve interprets already-loaded content and issues no new reads of Load files.

### Load (do this first)

**Wave 1 — read in ONE parallel batch, then never re-read these:**
- `.ai-agents/workspace/project-context.yaml`
- `.ai-agents/registry.yaml`
- `.ai-agents/config.yaml`
{{#activation_reads}}
- `.ai-agents/workspace/{{.}}`
{{/activation_reads}}

**Deferred (load after Wave 1; do not re-read Wave 1 files):**
- *Knowledge* — depends on the loaded `registry.yaml`; resolve and load per the rule in Resolve. May be serial (manifest-driven).
{{?extended_context}}
- *Extended Context* (listed below) — once `session.yaml` values such as `{active_change.id}` / `{plan_path}` are known, read the concrete files (e.g. `analysis.md`, `design.md`, `plan.yaml`, template paths) in ONE parallel sub-batch. Discovery directives (e.g. "scan the project root", "load source files per the bug description") are NOT files: load them on demand at runtime.

Extended Context entries:
{{/extended_context}}
{{#extended_context}}
- {{.}}
{{/extended_context}}

### Resolve (interpret loaded content — no new reads of Load files)

**Project Scope (PS)** — from `project-context.yaml > projects[]`:
- **Single project** → PS = [the sole project]. Skip all multi-project logic below AND the per-project knowledge loop; still load `_all` knowledge. This is the common case.
- **Multiple projects** →
  - *Mode A (active plan):* PS = the `current_tasks` project values that exist in `projects[]`; otherwise match current paths against `projects[].path` / `source_paths`; if still unresolved, list candidates and ask. Never silently load all.
  - *Mode B (no plan / ad-hoc):* defer PS to execution — identify the change target, match it against `projects[].path` / `source_paths`.

**Knowledge** — always load `knowledge._all` + `skills.<current-skill>.knowledge._all`. In multi-project Mode A/B, additionally load `knowledge[P]` + `skills.<current-skill>.knowledge[P]` for each resolved P. For every entry: base dir = `.ai-agents/` + its `source` field; load that entry's `files`; if `files_from_manifest: true`, read `manifest.yaml` in that dir and load entries with `auto_load: true`. Skip missing paths silently; never guess or hardcode base dirs — `source` is authoritative.

**Config** — apply `config.yaml` preferences for the whole session: `interaction_language` (chat/prompts/tables), `document_output_language` (files on disk), `output.no_emojis`, `output.data_format`, `context_routing.relevance_threshold`.
{{?has_preflight}}

**Pre-flight** — evaluate each check below against the loaded `session.yaml` / `project-context.yaml`. Levels: **WARN** = emit message, ask "Continue? (y/n)", default **y**; **BLOCK** / **REQUIRED** = emit and stop until satisfied; **INFO** = emit and proceed.
